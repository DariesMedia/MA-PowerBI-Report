## Medium-Articles-Performance-Analysis

Cleaning and analysing Medium.com Articles data as well as report design in PowerBI

## Introduction

This project was one that resulted from a search for a project that would involve working with real data and which the insights would be interesting to see. 

The documentation includes:
- Report Requirements
- Insight/Solutions
- Conclusion

## Report Requirement
While planning for this project the initial purpose of creating the report was to see the overall number of articles, best performing articles by category, highest & lowest reading time, highest response and which month had the highest engagement.

However, during the report design I was also interested in creating a report that tracks various factors influencing Medium Articles users engagement such as the length of the title, if or not a subtle is needed for better performance.

In summary, the report requirement was to provide an overall insight of the articles performace to enable me write better performing articles on medium.com

## Insight/Solution
After cleaning and analysing the data, attached below is the report.
